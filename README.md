Packages
========

Worse Barrels successor for ~~Fabric~~ Fabric and also Forge ~~1.15.2~~ ~~1.16.4~~ ~~1.17.0~~ ~~1.17.1~~ ~~1.18~~ ~~1.18.2~~ ~~1.19.2~~ ~~1.19.4~~ 1.20.1.

Package Crafter model by [Kat](https://kat.blue).

On Fabric, there's a soft dependency on FREX (transfers FREX texture materials onto the package model). Try it with your favorite Canvas shader with selfillum blocks or PBR. ~~Also has a soft dependency on Dashloader~~ Disabled for now, sorry about that.

# Tag usage note:

On Fabric if you have wooden chest items, tag them with `c:wooden_chests`. I am not up to date with `c:` tag conventions in the ecosystem. It should also read out of the `forge:chests/wooden` item tag on Forge (actually on both)
